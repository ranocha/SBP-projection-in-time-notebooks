> Since integration by parts is an important tool when deriving energy or entropy estimates for differential equations, one may conjecture that some form of summation by parts (SBP) property is necessarily involved in provably stable numerical methods. This article contributes to this topic by proposing a novel class of A stable SBP time integration methods including the classical Lobatto IIIA collocation method, not previously formulated as an SBP scheme. Additionally, a related SBP scheme including the classical Lobatto IIIB collocation method is developed.
